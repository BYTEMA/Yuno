## Set Up
1. `npm install` (Install required dependencies)
2. Make a copy of config.js.example and rename it to config.js. Change the contents to fit your needs and add your discord token.
3. (Optional) `npm install pm2 -g` (To keep the bot running || I suggest reading into how [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) works if you've never seen it before)

### Start
`npm run start`
or if you used step 3 in setup: `npm run startpm2`

### Stop
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> 
or if you used step 3 in setup: `npm run stoppm2`

## Who Is Yuno?
Yuno (Yuno Gasai) is base off a character from an Anime called Mirai Nikki (Future Diary). Honestly I just really like the character and thought she'd be a great theme for my discord bot :)
