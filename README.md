Meet Yuno, a discord bot built to be modular and easy to expand upon through Javascript using the Discord.js module.

 * Default Prefix: `.` or `@Yuno`

[Command List](https://zfbx.github.io/Yuno/) | [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kXbV9Zu)


## Set Up
`npm install` (Install required dependencies)
`node ./setup.js` (Basic Setup questions / config.json generator)
`npm install pm2 -g` (To keep the bot running || I suggest reading into how [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) works if you've never seen it before)

### Start
`npm run start` or `node ./index.js` for a single run

### Stop
`npm run stop` or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>

## Who Is Yuno?
Yuno (Yuno Gasai) is base off a character from an Anime called Mirai Nikki (Future Diary). Honestly I just really like the character and thought she'd be a great theme for my discord bot :)
